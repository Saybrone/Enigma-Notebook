# Enigma-Notebook
Enigma-Notebook is a private and secure terminal based text editor released as an alternative for [Nano](https://github.com/madnight/nano) and [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) with full text encryption. It contains the interface of the GNU Nano editor with simpler key bindings but allows users to encrypt their data by a password using Fernet and SHA256.
